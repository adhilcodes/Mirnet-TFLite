# Mirnet-TFLite

 - This Repo contains the TensorFlow Lite model conversion and inference processes for the **MIRNet** model as proposed by [Learning Enriched Features for Real Image Restoration and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06792v2.pdf). 

 - This model is capable of enhancing low-light images upto a great extent. 
 
 # Note 
 
  - This model was quantized using dynamic range quantization as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).
  - This model takes fixed-shaped **(400x400)** inputs (images with RGB channel).
  - This model is populated with metadata.
